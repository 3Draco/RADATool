This program connects to the RetroAchievements API to gather data on games per system that have achievements.

Export Options
The collected game data can be exported in two ways:

DAT File: A .dat file, typically designed for use with ROM managers or game databases.
Achievement Collections: This creates a .cfg file, specifically for RetroPie/Batocera, which includes only games with achievements for a given system.
API Usage Note
To minimize the number of requests to the RetroAchievements API and optimize performance, it's recommended to utilize the program's cache files.
